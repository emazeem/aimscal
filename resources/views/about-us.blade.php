                                <p>Scientific and technological advancement of a country demands an organized and globally connected metrology infrastructure. Scientific and legal metrology systems are normally taken care by public sector organizations like National Metrology Institutes and relevant ministries.</p>
                                <p>However, industrial metrology systems are dependent on traceable calibration services provided by private sector calibration laboratories.</p>
                                <p>In developing countries inadequate level of metrology education / awareness and incomplete traceability of measurement results bars the local production from highly competitive global market.</p>
                                <p>Calibration results accredited to ISO/IEC 17025: 2005 from ILAC MRA signatories like PNAC, GAC or DAC are like passports for locally produced goods and services to transit across the globe.</p>
                                <p>AIMS cherish a vision of providing complete traceability and assurance of measurement results to the BIPM through recognized NMI like NPL (UK), NIST (USA) and PTB (Germany) in compliance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025: 2005.</p>
